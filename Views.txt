A view is nothing more than a SQL statement that is stored in the database with an associated name. 
A view is actually a composition of a table in the form of a predefined SQL query.

-- Example
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS UserProjectsView;
GO

CREATE VIEW UserProjectsView AS
	SELECT TOP 20
		[u].[FirstName], [u].[LastName], [p].[Name] as 'Project'
	FROM 
		[UserProjects] as up
	JOIN
		[Users] as [u] on [up].[UserId] = [u].Id
	Join
		[Projects] as [p] on [up].[ProjectId] = [p].id
	ORDER BY -- Order By doesn't work without TOP or OFFSET
		[p].[Name]
GO

-- Query the view  
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM UserProjectsView;


Views vs Temp table
Views is about processing query each time
Temp table is about storing data
