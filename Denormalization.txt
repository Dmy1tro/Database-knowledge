Denormalization - intentional violation of normals forms, in order to increase performance


I. Why it would be necessary ?

1) A lot of JOINs in query (e.g 10 joins and more)
2) Calculated values
3) Heavy values (Blob, text(NVARCHAR(MAX)), etc.)

II. Pros and cons

It is worth to perform denormalization if wasted time for consistency support is less than 
time needed to execute the original query.
It is important to stay balanced between performance and consistency/redundancy of data
